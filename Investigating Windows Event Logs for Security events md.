## 🔐 What is Windows Forensics?

**Windows Forensics** is the process of:
- Collecting digital evidence from Windows systems
- Analyzing system and security logs
- Identifying suspicious or malicious activity
- Reconstructing attack timelines

👉 In simple words:  
**Windows Forensics helps us understand what happened on a Windows system after a security incident.**

---

## ❓ Why Windows Event Logs Are Important

Windows automatically records **almost every important activity** in the form of logs.

### Examples:
- User login and logout
- Failed password attempts
- Program execution
- System crashes
- Security policy changes

These logs help security teams answer:
- ❓ Who logged in?
- ❓ From where?
- ❓ When?
- ❓ Was it authorized or suspicious?
