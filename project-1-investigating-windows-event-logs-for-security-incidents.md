## 🔐 What is Windows Forensics?

**Windows Forensics** is the process of:
- Collecting digital evidence from Windows systems
- Analyzing system and security logs
- Identifying suspicious or malicious activity
- Reconstructing attack timelines

👉 In simple words:  
**Windows Forensics helps us understand what happened on a Windows system after a security incident.**

---

## ❓ Why Windows Event Logs Are Important

Windows automatically records **almost every important activity** in the form of logs.

### Examples:
- User login and logout
- Failed password attempts
- Program execution
- System crashes
- Security policy changes

These logs help security teams answer:
- ❓ Who logged in?
- ❓ From where?
- ❓ When?
- ❓ Was it authorized or suspicious?

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

Windows Event Log analysis is used in:

- 🔐 Incident Response
- 🚨 Brute-force attack detection
- 🕵️ Insider threat investigations
- 🦠 Malware & ransomware analysis
- 📑 Legal and compliance audits
- 🏦 Banking, healthcare, and government security

---

## 🧰 Lab Setup

### System Requirement
You need **one Windows machine**, either:
- Physical system  
OR  
- Virtual Machine (recommended)

### Virtualization Options
- Oracle VirtualBox
- VMware Workstation

---

## 📋 Pre-Requisites (Beginner Friendly)

- Basic understanding of Windows OS
- Familiarity with Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Administrator access on the system

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used in This Project

### 1️⃣ Event Viewer
- Built-in Windows tool
- Used to **view and analyze logs**
- No installation required

### 2️⃣ PowerShell
- Windows command-line and automation tool
- Used to **query and extract logs quickly**

### 3️⃣ Log Parser
- Microsoft tool
- Converts event logs into **CSV files**
- Very useful for forensic analysis

---

## 🔽 Installing Log Parser

## 🧪 Exercise 1: Accessing Windows Event Logs (Event Viewer)

### 🎯 Objective
Learn how to **open and navigate Windows Event Logs**.

### 🔍 What You Are Learning
- Where logs are stored
- Different types of logs
- How to identify security-related events

### 🪜 Steps

1. Press **Win + R**
2. Type: `eventvwr.msc`
3. Press **Enter**
4. Expand **Windows Logs**
5. Explore:
   - Application
   - Security
   - System

### 🧠 Key Focus
- Open **Security Log**
- Look for login-related events

### ✅ Expected Outcome
You can:
- Navigate Event Viewer
- Identify login events
- Understand log categories

---

## 🧪 Exercise 2: Filtering & Exporting Failed Logins

### 🎯 Objective
Filter failed login attempts and export them.

### 🔍 Why This Matters
Failed login attempts often indicate:
- Brute-force attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Unauthorized access attempts

### 🪜 Steps

1. Open **Security** log in Event Viewer
2. Right-click → **Filter Current Log**
3. Enter **Event ID**: `4625`
4. Click **OK**
5. Right-click filtered results → **Save Filtered Log File As**
6. Save as: `FailedLogins.evtx`

### ✅ Expected Outcome
A separate file containing **only failed login attempts**.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 3: Parsing Logs Using Log Parser

### 🎯 Objective
Convert event logs into readable CSV format.

### 🔍 Why This Matters
CSV files:
- Are easy to analyze
- Can be imported into Excel, Splunk, etc.

### 🪜 Command

```bash
LogParser.exe "SELECT TimeGenerated, EventID, EventTypeName, Message FROM FailedLogins.evtx" -i:EVT -o:CSV > FailedLogins.csv
```

### ✅ Expected Outcome
A CSV file containing:
- Time of failed login
- Event ID
- Event details

---

## 🧪 Exercise 4: Analyzing Logs Using PowerShell

### 🎯 Objective
Use PowerShell to automate log analysis.

### 🔍 What You Learn
- Query logs quickly
- Automate forensic tasks

### 🪜 Commands

View failed logins:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} |
  Format-Table TimeCreated, Id, Message -AutoSize
```

Save output:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} |
  Export-Csv -Path FailedLogins.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

> Tip: Use `Out-File` if you want raw text output instead of CSV.

### ✅ Expected Outcome
- Console output of failed logins
- Saved forensic report (`FailedLogins.csv`)

---

## 🧪 Exercise 5: Correlating Events (Advanced Analysis)

### 🎯 Objective
Compare failed and successful logins.

### 🔍 Why This Matters
Detect brute-force success

### 🪜 Correlation Logic
- Event ID `4625` → Failed login
- Event ID `4624` → Successful login

Use timestamps, account names, and source IPs to correlate sequences of failures followed by a success.

### 🧪 Analysis Outcome
- Identify patterns
- Detect suspicious user behavior
- Build attack timeline

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
